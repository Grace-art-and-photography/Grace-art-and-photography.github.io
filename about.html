<h1>About the Artist</h1>
<img src="about.jpg" alt="Photo of Grace Austin" style="width:450px">
<p>"Since I was 7, I have been composing and capturing photos.  Photography has been a life long passion that I have spent the past 6 years honing skills at San Jose State University.  I have shot a wide variety of photograph genres.  Such includes: Narrative, Editorial, Studio / Portraits, Stage,  Fashion, Food, Product, and Social Justice.  In addition, I have experience in graphic design and videography!  In my free time I enjoy social dancing and painting.".</p>
