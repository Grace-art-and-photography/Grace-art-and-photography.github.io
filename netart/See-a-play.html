<h1>You chose:See a play!</h1>
<p>What a correct choice! You decide to see Hamlet!&%^*#)&@*$&*^*#$^% You get pit tickets for a pence. However when you show up the theater is empty. No audience. No Cast. No set.  Your certian that the time is correct.  Silly you. Don't you know that Hamelt was Hamlet was realsed in 1603?</p>
<p> Why would the vendor sell you a ticket for a show that dosent exist yet?
