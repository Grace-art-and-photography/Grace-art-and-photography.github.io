Whose woods these are I think I know.   

His house is in the village though;   

He will not see me stopping here  

To watch his woods fill up with snow.   


My little horse must think it queer   

To stop without a farmhouse near   

Between the woods and frozen lake   

The darkest evening of the year.   


He gives his harness bells a shake   

To ask if there is some mistake.   

The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   

Of easy wind and downy flake.   


The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  
 
But I have promises to keep,   

And miles to go before I sleep,   

And miles to go before I sleep.
